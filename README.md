# Elevator Model Checking

This repository is related to my team's project for [formal methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods) course by Dr.Pouria Khanzadi.

Here we have modeled a simple elevator using [promela/spin](https://spinroot.com/spin/whatispin.html) and [NuSMV](https://nusmv.fbk.eu) and verified this system.
